This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, bug in C++ related to the `std::vector<bool>` specialization.  The issue stems from the fact that `std::vector<bool>` optimizes for space, often resulting in non-intuitive behavior when compared to other standard vector types. The `bug.cpp` file shows an example of such a problem, while `bugSolution.cpp` offers a corrected solution using a standard `std::vector<int>` or `std::vector<bool>` with careful consideration.
