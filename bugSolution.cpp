Instead of using `std::vector<bool>`, consider using `std::vector<int>` (for boolean values represented as 0 and 1) or `std::vector<bool>` while explicitly managing potential issues due to its space-optimization strategy.  Directly manipulating elements via indexing needs to be performed with care in `std::vector<bool>`.  If element access speed is critical then consider other options.  For example, if you are using a bool vector for representing bits (where space optimization is critical), consider using `std::bitset` instead.
